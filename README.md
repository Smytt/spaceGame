<h1>Ninja Defense</h1>
<p>Ninja Defense is a Java based game in which you take the controls
    over a space ship which only purpose is to defend the planet where The Coding Ninja lives.
    You have to kill all invading aliens, while you manage to drift between space debris such as comets,
    against which your weapons are USELESS. Be carfeul, because there are also
    floating alien heads out there. If they manage to pass by you and reach the planet,
    they will abduct The Coding Ninja.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be some help.
    We managed to program a little piece of software,
    which can teleport food and ammo in space, so you can charge up.
    Stay alive long enough and you will even be able to level up to a strnger ship.</p>

<p>Be brave, becuase with great OOPP*, comes the great OOPR**.</p>

    **OOPR - Object Oriented Programming Responsibility.</p>
